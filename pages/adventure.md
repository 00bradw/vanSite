This is a gallery of some of the places I've taken the van over the years. The van is fairly stealth and very secure against intrusion; affording dwelling experiences in both urban and rural settings. The short body length is an advantage which allows parking wherever a standard sedan may fit. In addition, at an average of 25 mpg, the van has covered much distance across the United States with ease.
