This is a tour of the design and features of the van:

## Van

I chose the 2013 Ford Transit Connect because of its efficient size. It's a a 94" long van, which is shorter than many 4 door sedans, but the cargo bay is over 6' long in the back, allowing someone like me to sleep comfortably. I can drive and park this van anywhere a car can go, camp in the back, while getting up to 28mpg on the highway. As someone who wanted a daily driver + adventure vehicle in one, this van is the perfect fit.

## Security

I bought the model with no glass windows on the side nor rear, which is less common for these vans. This was an important requirement because when I bought it, and for much of its life, I was in California, which means car break-ins were inevitable. For an adventure van which could hold many valuable pieces of equipment at any given time, I wanted to minimize the ability to steal items in the back as much as possible. This lack of glass, combined with the steel bulkhead behind the seats separating the cockpit with the rear cabin, makes stealing items in the back was made more difficult. The van has been broken in to a few times (through the front windows), and in all instances, the thieves never got through the steel bulkhead into the back.

The trade-off with the steel bulkhead is that you lose the ability to jump from the cabin to the camper without exiting the van. This is a great feature for camping in bad weather or trying to be stealth. Therefore, I made the bulkhead easily removable and storable, to keep the van open when camping, and secure in risky settings. The bulkhead can be opened and stored in the back in a matter of minutes. This is great for longer trips which include the occasional risky area. For most short trips to remote locations, I keep the bulkhead at home to keep space available.

For privacy, a retractable blackout curtain is installed in between the cabin and living area.

## Cockpit

The Ford Transit Connect comes in XL and XLT trim packages. This van is an XL; meaning it has crank windows, no electronic locks or seats, and basic entertainment system. However, I have upgraded the entertainment console to a premium stereo system.

Above the seats, I have extended the overhead shelf to be accessible from the living cabin. This deep shelf takes advantage of the tall ceiling over the seats.

## Audio Mods

This van secretly has a great sound system. There are aftermarket Alpine speakers installed in the doors and a Kickr subwoofer bolted down below the drivers seat. Keeping in line with security concerns, the speakers are completely hidden from view behind the cheap stock plastic covers on the door, and the subwoofer is hidden below the seat, and cannot be removed without un-bolting the seat from the car. The sound system is controlled with a removable alpine stereo tuner which can connect to devices via bluetooth.

## Living

Simply, the cabin is a bench on one side, and kitchen counter on the other side, with a "hallway" passing from the cockpit to the rear doors. You can either enter the cabin by climbing in back from the cockpit, or the rear two doors.

The living configurations are based around two module squares for furniture. The squares are strategically hinged to fold into the seat and base of the bench, forming a 22in wide seating platform (the width of most sleeping pads and yoga mats), and 14" tall base (standard height for sitting). Together, the squares form a 6'3" long bench, allowing most people to lay comfortably in the back of the van. When flattened, the squares can be rotated and spanned to sit on the kitchen's ledge to form a twin sized (53") wide platform (which is half of 6'3"), while remaining as half of the 6'3" length (16" base + 45" seat). This "convertible square" allows a fold for the bench, which won't collapse when spanning for a sleeping platform.

The squares can be easily removed to access the large storage area below the bench.

The concept of this van is to have no permanent mattress or cushions for sleeping or sitting. Mattresses and cushions are very bulky, hard to store when not being slept on, and are magnets for filth and stains. Rather, this van expects that you will use standard sleeping mats or inflatable mattresses which are easy to store and keep the van spatious when not sleeping. As such, the dimensions of the sleeping configurations are designed to accomodate typical sizes for these products.

### Sleeping configuration 1: "Quick Rest"

The bench is 22" wide, and will comfotably support most off-the-shelf sleeping mats. This allows a camper to quickly set up a mat to sleep on after climbing into the back of the van. This is personally my favorite configuration. Simple, minimal setup time, and I can sit up on the bench before and after lying down.

### Sleeping configuration 2: "Comfortable Twin"

The squares can unfold to become flat and create a sleeping platform that spans from the ege of the kitchen to the back of the bench. This platform is 52" wide, which is the standard "twin" bed width. As such, this platform will comfortably hold an off-the-shelf twin mattress of your liking. While you could put a foam mattress here, for the reasons mentioned above, the simplest configuration is inflating a mattress when you're ready to sleep. This configuration is roomy and comfortable for one camper, and can snugly accomodate two campers.

## Sleeping configuration 3: "Queen Camping"

Similar to the twin configuration, the platform can span flush with the top of the kitchen counter to become a 60" wide (queen sized) sleeping platform. The kitchen counter is specifically designed with this configuration in mind; the sink faucet is mounted in back of the counter and can fold away, and the sink and burned basin have covers which are flush with the rest of the counter top. In this configuration, campers can use most off-the-shelf queen sized sleeping mats, or two single mats joined together.

## Kitchen

The kitchen utilities consist of a sink with a deep basin, and another basin to hold a standard propane camping stove. Below the burner is a refridgerator. The sink is supplied with a small pump which draws fresh water from a 5 gallon jug. This jug is sunken into the floor behind the driver seat, and is configured to be easily removed for refilling stations. The jug connects into the plumbing with a quick release mechanism. Below the sink is a grey water jug which can also be easily removed for dumping. The kitchen has an easily removable panel to access the grey water and under-sink area. Below the kitchen counter area are two large storage drawers on slow-close slides, and a storage cabinet.

The kitchen sink and burner are located next to the door, so campers can "cook with a view," have ventilation, and also cook from the outside if desired. The counter remains at a convenient height when standing on the outside, and the sink faucet is flexible to allow for outdoor use. Additionally, when the sink faucet is articulate towards the outside, it makes for a great shower head!

## Plumbing

The sink is supplied via a 5 gallon water jug behind the driver's seat, and drains to a removable grey water tank below the sink basin. The fresh water jug is attached to the plumbing supply line via a custom made quick release nozzle, which attaches to a custom made "straw" extending to the bottom of the jug. The jug configuration is designed to be easily removed from the van for refilling on the go.

## Bike Rack and Storage Box

The bike rack is specifically fitted to allow for the doors to open with enough clearance. The bike rack also makes for a great "step" in and out of the rear of the van.

The roof storage box is accessible by stepping up on the van's structure below the floor, and holding on to some roof-mounted handles.
