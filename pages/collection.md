This is a gallery of some other first generation Ford Transit Connect vans I've spotted throughout the years. The FTC is a popular van to customize, usually for business purposes, and the variety of liveries and colors never cease to catch my eye. If I see an FTC, I "collect" it with a photograph, and add it to this collection.
