This website serves to document my 2013 Ford Transit Connect camper van conversion project. I purchased the van used in 2017 in San Jose, CA and it's been my daily driver and adventure mobile ever since. Prior to my ownership, the van served as a maintenance fleet vehicle at the Google headquarters in Mountain View, CA, where it was well and regularly maintained. 

The van is currently for sale, and the classified listing can be found <a href="https://lasvegas.craigslist.org/cto/d/las-vegas-2013-ford-transit-connect/7815965774.html" style="color:blue;">here</a>.
 The van is currently at ~93k miles and is located with me in Las Vegas, NV. It's in great condition and I'm selling it to move on to new projects. Please contact me through the email link on this website or through Instagram if you are interesting in buying the van or scheduling a time to come look at it. I am also perpetually interested in other people's FTC builds, so please do not hesitate to share yours with me!
